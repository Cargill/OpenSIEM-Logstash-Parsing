    type: date
    description: 'Date/time when the event originated.

      This is the date/time extracted from the event, typically representing when
      the event was generated by the source.

      If the event source has no original timestamp, this value is typically populated
      by the first time the event was received by the pipeline.

      Required field for all events.'

    description: 'Custom key/value pairs.

      Can be used to add meta information to events. Should not contain nested objects.

    example: '{"application": "foo-bar", "env": "production"}'
  - name: message
    level: core
    type: text
    description: 'For log events the message field contains the log message, optimized
      for viewing in a log viewer.

      For structured logs without an original message field, other fields can be concatenated
      to form a human-readable summary of the event.

      If multiple messages exist, they can be combined into one message.'

      shall be populated with details of the agent running on the host or observer
      where the event happened or the measurement was taken.'
    footnote: 'Examples: In the case of Beats for logs, the agent.name is filebeat.
      For APM, it is the agent running in the app/service. The agent information does

        two Filebeat instances are running on the same host but a human readable separation

      events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

      For TCP events, the client is the initiator of the TCP connection that sends
      the SYN packet(s). For other protocols, the client is generally the initiator
      or requestor in the network transaction. Some systems use the term "originator"
      to refer the client in TCP connections. The client fields describe details about
      the system acting as the client in the network event. Client fields are usually
      populated in conjunction with server fields. Client fields are generally not
      populated for packet-level events.

      Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange, which
      is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations. If your context falls
      in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled

      description: 'Name of a service node.

        This allows for two nodes of the same service running on the same host to
        be differentiated. Therefore, `service.node.name` should typically be unique
        across nodes of a given service.

        In the case of Elasticsearch, the `service.node.name` could contain the unique
        node name within the Elasticsearch cluster. In cases where the service doesn''t
        have the concept of a node name, the host name or container name can be used
        to distinguish running instances that make up this service. If those do not
        provide uniqueness (e.g. multiple instances of the service running on the
        same host) - the node name can be manually set.'
